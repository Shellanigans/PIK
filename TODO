Graphical process selector (live list view instead of clicker)
Graphical dimension setter for windows selected
    Maybe live update window text and dimensions?
Gracefully handle multiple instances of PIK running
still missing configuration to set stop hotkey (or programmable hotkeys in general)
    Also show the hotkey code in the right click menu
    programmable hotkeys should be settable with the clickable button thing that games do
    dont forget a default reset
just move all the shit into C# there's no reason for it to be posh other than runnability at this point.
    speaking of C#... NO MO REGEX (in places it can be helped)
    condense interpreter into the GUI.parse C# stuff
    breakout C# into multiple pieces
still missing help file
revisit loading/saving of profiles
    Maybe rename to programs???
    Should profiles refer to settings???
    are settings important with programs or macros?
screenshotter? (for if you are tryng to catch something?)
fix syntax highlighting only look at lines changed (basically get rid of it as a command/hotkey)
    (need to consider when new lines are added and strings that are multi-line like block comments)
Memory scanner??? Like cheat engine???
Server Client stuff is fucked, get them both in the same place and actually pass the stream object correctly
    Keepalive is hella dumb as well
    live push commands and return output to server/client comms (just like a textbox that can do that or something)
    Packet crafting???
    TLS/SSL for comms???
